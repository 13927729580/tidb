# Labels Proposal

## Goals

* synchronise labels between repos, especially priority labels
* make colours more useful by making them more uniform

## Current issues

* Priotiry labels settings needs to be synchronised among repos.

* TiDB uses a `category/label` scheme, but with some exceptions

- closed, component, priority, status, type

## Proposal

### Naming Aternatives

* Use `category/label` naming schemes
* More categories (e.g., a bot category)
* Allow labels without categories
* Add emoji to highlight some labels or sub-categories
* Separate labels for issues vs PRs

### The labels
`*` indicates I think we should remove an issue, there might be a suggested replacement in `<...>`. `?` means I don't know what the label means.

### Priotity lables

* Priority labels synchronising proposal:

```
priority/critical-urgent        #cc2400        Highest priority. Must be actively worked on as someone's top priority right now. Release blocker.
priority/important-longterm     #fe5733        Important over the long term, but may not be staffed and/or may need multiple releases to complete.
priority/important-soon         #fe5733        Must be staffed and worked on either currently, or very soon, ideally in time for the next release.
priority/backlog                #feca33        Higher priority than priority/awaiting-more-evidence.
priority/awaiting-more-evidence #ffe599        Lowest priority. Possibly useful, but not yet enough support to actually get it done.
needs-priority                  #cdcdcd        Indicates a PR lacks a `priority/foo` label and requires one.
```

* Repos current settings which need to optimize

- TiDB

```
priority/individual-blocker
Priority/P0
Priority/P1
priority/P2
priority/release-blocker
Priority/Unknown
```

- TiKV

```
priority/critical
priority/high
priority/low
priority/release-blocker
```

- PD

```
priority/P0
priority/P1
priority/P2
priority/release-blocker        
```

- tics (TiFlash)

```

priority/p1
priority/p2
priority/release-blocker
```

- br

```

```

- TiDB-binlog

```

```

### Other labels

* TiDB repo paticularly needs to optimize. Current labels and colours are on the left, proposed are on the right.
